# Chat Bot (Echo Bot) ðŸ¤–

This is a simple Python-based chat bot that currently echoes user input. In the future, this project will be upgraded with natural language processing (NLP) features to turn it into a fully functional chat bot capable of engaging in dynamic conversations.

## Features

- **Echo Bot**: Currently, the bot simply echoes whatever the user inputs.
- **Planned Upgrades**: Future plans include adding natural language processing to understand and respond intelligently to user input.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to support new functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the echo bot locally, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+ (preferably in a virtual environment)
- Pip (Python's package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat_bot.git
2. Navigate to project directory:
   cd chat_bot
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
# Running the Echo Bot
To start the chat bot (which currently echoes input), simply run:
python chat_bot.py

# Example Output
Hello! I am your echo bot. Type something and I'll repeat it.
> Hello, bot!
Hello, bot!

# Future Improvements
- Natural Language Processing: Integrating NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or GPT-3 to allow the bot to understand and respond to user input in a meaningful way.
- Custom Responses: The bot will be able to offer personalized or helpful responses based on the context of the conversation.
- Machine Learning: Future versions might incorporate machine learning to improve the botâ€™s performance over time based on user interactions.

# Technologies Used
- Python: The main programming language for this project.
- Other Libraries: [List any other libraries you're using.]

### Key Points:
- The README is written to reflect that the bot is currently an echo bot, with future upgrades planned for adding more sophisticated chatbot features like NLP.
- The **Future Improvements** section specifically highlights plans for further development.
- The rest of the structure is typical for a project README, including installation instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.
